										<h2 id="content">Project Overview</h2>
										<p>The liquid propulsion team is the largest team within Sun Devil Rocketry, and aims to develop and test ASU's first liquid propellant rocket engine. The team has designed and manufactured a number of custom pieces of hardware, including an injector, a radiatively-cooled combustion chamber, several custom avionics PCBs, a component testing apparatus, and a structural test stand. Each piece of custom equipment has gone through multiple design iterations and dozens of hours of computational analysis. The team is organized into five different sub-teams, including the propulsion, plumbing, avionics, structures, and test operations subteams. The project has been in development for three years, and has been led by three different generations of Sun Devil Rocketry engineers. The project's purpose is to provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to gain hands-on learning experience relevant to the modern aerospace industry, and to date over 50 students at ASU have contributed to the project.

										<h2 id="content">Personal Involvement</h2>
										<p>
I have been involved in the liquids project since its beginning in the fall of 2019, and have held two different leadership roles within the team. For the last two years I have led the avionics subteam, and I served as overall team lead during the 2021-2022 school year. As liquids team lead, I facilitated development of the project by holding weekly team meetings, scheduling safety trainings, managing university relations, and writing budgeting proposals. I pushed the team to progress from the design phase to the testing and rapid-prototyping phase after Sun Devil Rocketry regained access to the student organization shop space after a year of virtual work during the peak of the COVID pandemic. With respect to technical contributions, I have architected the engine's entire avionics system from the user interface to the engine control circuitry. Currently, the avionics system consists of a central engine controller, a valve-controller, six solenoids, two servo-actuated ball valves, two optoelectronic photogate sensors, a ground-station computer, and a custom user interface python application. For more information on the specifics of these avionics systems, see their designated pages <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

												<h3>Propulsion</h3>
												<p>The propulsion subteam is responsible for the design of the engine's combustion chamber and injector. The team mainly performs computational fluid dynamics simulations to characterize the engine's combustion, thermodynamics, mixing, and structural stability. Currently the team is working to manufacture the combustion chamber and characterize the injector's flow coefficient and mixing characteristics.  </p>

												<h3>Plumbing</h3>
												<p>The plumbing team is responsible for the design and development of the liquid engine's propellant feed system. The propellant feed system delivers the kerosene and liquid oxygen propellants from their tanks to the combustion chamber. The plumbing system also manages the pressurization system which pressurizes the propellants using gaseous nitrogen and purges residual propellants from the system after ignition. The plumbing system consists of ball valves, solenoids, check valves, relief valves, tanks, pressure transducers, thermocouples, pressure regulators, orifices, pressure gauges, pipes and fittings.</p>

												<h3>Test Operations</h3>
												<p>Development of the liquid rocket engine is driven by testing and experimental characterization of engine components. The test operations team is responsible for designing and conducting component tests to verify proper operation of engine components and to inform future design and development. The test operations team has developed a component testing apparatus shown in the image to the right which allows SDR engineers to collect data on the flow characteristics of plumbing components. Tests performed by the test operations team have included pressure transducer calibration, orifice flow meter calibration, injector pressure drop characterization, and injector mixing performance.</p>

												<h3>Avionics</h3>
												<p>In order to control the propellant feed system in an efficient and safe manner, the engine must be controlled by a semi-autonomous avionics system. The avionics team is responsible for the design of the engine controls, data acquisition systems, and user interface. The avionics system allows for remote control of the engine's valves through the use of solenoids, servo-actuated valves, and wireless communication links.</p>

The structures team performs Ansys static structural simulations to determine points of high stress in the test stand while the engine is producing thrust. The structures team is currently working to weld the test stand together and drill necessary mounting holes.</p>
